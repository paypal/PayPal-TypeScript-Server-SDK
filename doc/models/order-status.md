## Enumeration

`OrderStatus`

## Fields

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| `Created` | The order was created with the specified context. |
| `Saved` | The order was saved and persisted. The order status continues to be in progress until a capture is made with final_capture = true for all purchase units within the order. |
| `Approved` | The customer approved the payment through the PayPal wallet or another form of guest or unbranded payment. For example, a card, bank account, or so on. |
| `Voided` | All purchase units in the order are voided. |
| `Completed` | The intent of the order was completed and a `payments` resource was created. Important: Check the payment status in `purchase_units[].payments.captures[].status` before fulfilling the order. A completed order can indicate a payment was authorized, an authorized payment was captured, or a payment was declined. |
| `PayerActionRequired` | The order requires an action from the payer (e.g. 3DS authentication). Redirect the payer to the "rel":"payer-action" HATEOAS link returned as part of the response prior to authorizing or capturing the order. Some payment sources may not return a payer-action HATEOAS link (eg. MB WAY). For these payment sources the payer-action is managed by the scheme itself (eg. through SMS, email, in-app notification, etc). |
